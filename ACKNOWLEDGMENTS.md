# Acknowledgments

This project would not exist without the incredible work of many individuals and communities who reverse-engineered the Acaia BLE protocol and built the libraries this project depends on.

## üôè Primary Credit

### **Tate Mazer** (@tatemazer)
**Creator and Primary Developer of AcaiaArduinoBLE**

This project is based on Tate's excellent [AcaiaArduinoBLE](https://github.com/tatemazer/AcaiaArduinoBLE) library, which provides the complete BLE communication implementation for Acaia scales on ESP32 and Arduino platforms.

**Tate's Contributions:**
- Created and maintains AcaiaArduinoBLE library (2023-present)
- Supports multiple scale types: Acaia Lunar, Pearl S, Pyxis, BooKoo Themis
- Developed hardware V3.1 PCB for scale integration
- Connection watchdog and reliability improvements
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

## üõ†Ô∏è This Project's Modifications

### **SongKeat** (This Fork)

**Scope:** This is a **specialized fork** for embedded UI applications, NOT a general-purpose improvement.

**My Specific Contributions:**
1. **LVGL Integration** - Added UI timer handling during BLE operations to prevent display freeze
2. **Production Validation** - Tested on **one specific setup**:
   - Machine: La Marzocco (LM) Micra espresso machine
   - Scale: Acaia Lunar (USB-C, 2021 version)
   - Display: LilyGO T-Display-S3-Long (180x640 QSPI)
3. **Issue #7 Report** - Documented ESP32-S3 17-byte packet behavior
4. **Serial.print Fix** - Commented out blocking calls in init() for LVGL compatibility

**Important Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **NOT tested on:** Pyxis, Pearl S, BooKoo Themis, Felicita Arc
- ‚ùå **NOT tested on:** Other espresso machines or hardware platforms
- ‚ùå **Single machine validation only:** LM Micra + Acaia Lunar
- ‚ùå **Upstream has MORE features:** Debug mode, broader scale support, ongoing development

**This fork is optimized for my specific use case (embedded LVGL UI). For general scale integration, use [Tate's upstream library](https://github.com/tatemazer/AcaiaArduinoBLE) which is more actively maintained and supports more scales.**

## üí¨ Acaia's Position

**Important Note:** Acaia has **never officially released** BLE protocol documentation.

- Acaia released closed-source iOS/Android SDKs (binary only, no source code)
- Acaia declined requests to open the protocol (per Beanconqueror community)
- All community implementations are **reverse-engineered**
- Acaia firmware updates sometimes change the protocol

**Reverse engineering was necessary because Acaia chose not to document the public interface of their Bluetooth-enabled products.**

## üéØ Recommendation

**If you're building a scale integration project:**

1. **Start with Tate's library:** https://github.com/tatemazer/AcaiaArduinoBLE
   - Actively maintained
   - Supports more scales (Lunar, Pyxis, Pearl S, BooKoo Themis)
   - Community support via Discord
   - Better tested across hardware

2. **Use this fork ONLY if:**
   - You need LVGL UI integration
   - You have LM Micra + Acaia Lunar (exact same setup as tested)
   - You understand the limited testing scope

**Tate's library is the definitive community implementation. This is a specialized fork for a specific use case.**
