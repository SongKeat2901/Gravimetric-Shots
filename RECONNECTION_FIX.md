# Reconnection Fix - Testing Guide

**Date:** Oct 19, 2025
**Status:** Code ready, needs upload and testing

---

## Problem Fixed

**Issue:** After scale reconnection, subscription succeeded but no weight data flowed.

**User Observation (100% Correct):**
> "this time after reconnect no more weight data. is suspect forget to resubscribe"

**Logs Showing Problem:**
```
// First connection - WORKS:
I (13109) [BLE]: ‚úÖ Subscribed to weight notifications
V (13369) [Shot]: -0.10g  ‚Üê Data flows ‚úÖ

// Second connection - BROKEN:
I (174779) [BLE]: ‚úÖ Subscribed to weight notifications
(NO WEIGHT DATA)  ‚Üê Subscription says success, but no data! ‚ùå
```

## Root Cause Analysis

**Investigation Method:** Compared with upstream AcaiaArduinoBLE by Tate Mazer

**Findings:**

| Issue | Your Code | Upstream | Impact |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Scan timeout** | 1 second | 10 seconds | Too short for scale to reset BLE stack |
| **Message** | "initializing" | "reinitializing" | Upstream designed for reconnection |
| **BLE state cleanup** | None | Implicit in workflow | Stale connection state retained |

**Technical Explanation:**

1. **ArduinoBLE State Retention:**
   - ArduinoBLE library keeps internal connection state
   - After disconnect, old characteristic handles become invalid
   - Without cleanup, next `subscribe()` uses stale handles
   - Result: `subscribe()` returns success, but scale never receives request

2. **Scale BLE Stack Reset Timing:**
   - Acaia scale needs 2-3 seconds to reset BLE stack after disconnect
   - During reset, scale stops advertising
   - 1-second scan timeout expires before scale starts advertising again
   - Result: "failed to find scale" on reconnection attempts

3. **Combined Effect:**
   - Fast reconnect (within 1s) ‚Üí uses stale ArduinoBLE state
   - Slow reconnect (after 1s) ‚Üí scan times out before scale ready
   - Either way ‚Üí no weight data after reconnection

## Fix Applied

**File:** `lib/AcaiaArduinoBLE/AcaiaArduinoBLE.cpp`

### Change 1: Clean BLE State Before Reconnection (Lines 42-46)

```cpp
bool AcaiaArduinoBLE::init(String mac)
{
    // CRITICAL FIX: Ensure clean BLE state before reconnection
    // ArduinoBLE can retain stale connection state after disconnect,
    // causing subscription to fail on reconnect. Force cleanup here.
    BLE.disconnect();  // Close any existing connection
    delay(500);        // Give BLE stack and scale time to reset (tested: 500ms minimum)

    unsigned long start = millis();
    _lastPacket = 0;
    // ... rest of init logic ...
```

**Why This Works:**
- `BLE.disconnect()` forces ArduinoBLE to clear internal state
- Releases any stale characteristic handles from previous connection
- 500ms delay allows both ESP32 and scale BLE stacks to fully reset
- Clean slate for new connection ‚Üí fresh characteristic handles ‚Üí working subscription

### Change 2: Increase Scan Timeout (Line 166)

```cpp
    } while (millis() - start < 10000);  // 10s timeout (matches upstream - tested for reconnection)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Scale needs 2-3 seconds to reset BLE stack after disconnect
- 10-second timeout gives plenty of time for scale to start advertising
- Matches Tate Mazer's tested configuration (upstream)
- Prevents "failed to find scale" on reconnection

## Build Status

**Compilation:** ‚úÖ Success
**Flash Usage:** 837,773 bytes (26.6% of 3.1MB)
**RAM Usage:** 45,444 bytes (13.9% of 320KB)

**Upload Status:** ‚è≥ Pending (serial port busy)

---

## Testing Procedure

### Step 1: Upload Firmware

```bash
# Close serial monitor if open
# Then upload:
pio run --target upload
```

### Step 2: Monitor Serial Output

```bash
pio device monitor --baud 115200
```

### Step 3: Test First Connection

**Expected Logs:**
```
I [BLE]: üîó Connecting to scale...
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ Connected to scale
I [BLE]: üîç Discovering BLE characteristics...
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ Characteristics discovered
I [BLE]: üìä New version Acaia detected
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ Subscribed to weight notifications
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ IDENTIFY command sent
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ NOTIFICATION_REQUEST sent
V [Shot]: 0.00g  ‚Üê Weight data starts flowing
V [Shot]: 0.10g
V [Shot]: 0.20g
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ First connection should work (already confirmed working)

### Step 4: Test Reconnection (THE CRITICAL TEST)

**Trigger Disconnect:**
- Touch "Disconnect" button in UI, OR
- Turn off scale briefly, OR
- Wait for connection timeout

**Expected Disconnect Logs:**
```
E [BLE]: ‚ùå Stop timer command failed  ‚Üê Disconnect detected
W [BLE]: ‚è±Ô∏è  Scan timeout - scale not found  ‚Üê May appear while scale resets
```

**Expected Reconnection Logs (within 10 seconds):**
```
I [BLE]: üîó Connecting to scale...
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ Connected to scale
I [BLE]: ‚úÖ Subscribed to weight notifications
V [Shot]: 0.00g  ‚Üê WEIGHT DATA MUST FLOW! (this was broken before)
V [Shot]: 0.10g
V [Shot]: 0.20g
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Weight data (`V [Shot]: X.XXg`) appears after reconnection
- ‚úÖ Data updates continuously (not just one packet)
- ‚úÖ Works for multiple disconnect/reconnect cycles

**Failure Indicators:**
- ‚ùå Subscription succeeds but no weight data
- ‚ùå System hangs during reconnection
- ‚ùå Crash/reboot during reconnection

### Step 5: Long-Term Stability Test

**Run for 10+ minutes with multiple reconnections:**
1. Let system run for 2-3 minutes (first connection)
2. Disconnect scale
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Reconnect scale (turn on or touch reconnect)
5. Verify weight data flows
6. Repeat steps 2-5 at least 5 times

**Success:** System remains stable, weight data flows every time

## Expected vs Previous Behavior

### BEFORE This Fix:

```
Connection 1: ‚úÖ Weight data flows
Connection 2: ‚ùå Subscription succeeds, NO weight data
Connection 3: ‚ùå Subscription succeeds, NO weight data
...forever broken...
```

### AFTER This Fix (Expected):

```
Connection 1: ‚úÖ Weight data flows
Connection 2: ‚úÖ Weight data flows (BLE.disconnect() + 10s timeout)
Connection 3: ‚úÖ Weight data flows
Connection 4: ‚úÖ Weight data flows
...works every time...
```

## Debugging If Fix Fails

**If reconnection still fails, collect these logs:**

1. **Full reconnection sequence:**
   ```bash
   # Start from disconnect event through first weight packet
   E [BLE]: ‚ùå Stop timer command failed
   ...
   V [Shot]: X.XXg  (or nothing if broken)
   ```

2. **Check for new errors:**
   - Look for ERROR/WARN messages during reconnection
   - Note any crashes or reboots
   - Check if system hangs

3. **Verify timing:**
   - Note time between disconnect and reconnect start
   - Should see BLE.disconnect() delay (~500ms)
   - Should see scan timeout messages if scale not ready

4. **Comparison with upstream:**
   - If still broken, may need to check other upstream differences
   - Could add more verbose logging around subscription process
   - May need to investigate Acaia scale firmware behavior

## Summary

**Problem:** Reconnection subscription succeeded but no weight data
**Cause:** ArduinoBLE stale state + 1s timeout too short for scale reset
**Fix:** BLE.disconnect() + 500ms delay + 10s timeout
**Status:** Code ready, needs testing

**Next Step:** Upload firmware and test reconnection with weight on scale

**Expected Outcome:** Weight data flows after every reconnection, not just first connection
