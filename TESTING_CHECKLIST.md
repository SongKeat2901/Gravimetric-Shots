## System Architecture Overview

```
Core 0 (BLE/WiFi)          Core 1 (Application/UI)
==================         ====================
bleTaskFunction()          loop()
  ‚îú‚îÄ BLE operations          ‚îú‚îÄ LVGL UI updates
  ‚îú‚îÄ Scale connection        ‚îú‚îÄ Touch handling
  ‚îú‚îÄ Weight readings         ‚îú‚îÄ Display sleep/wake

## üß™ PHASE 1: UI RESPONSIVENESS TESTS

### Test 1.1: Touch During BLE Connection
**Goal:** Verify main objective - UI remains responsive during 8-15 second BLE connection

**Prerequisites:**
- Scale powered OFF (forces long connection timeout)
- Fresh boot

**Test Steps:**
1. Power on ESP32, wait for main screen
2. Scale should attempt connection (8-15 second timeout expected)
3. **DURING CONNECTION ATTEMPT:**
   - Touch navigation buttons
   - Attempt to open settings screen
   - Try tare/start/stop buttons
   - Scroll through UI elements

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] UI responds immediately to touch (<100ms perceived)
- [ ] No UI freezing or lag
- [ ] Buttons visually respond (press animation)
- [ ] Screen transitions work smoothly

- Any UI freezes? (Yes/No, duration)
- Any visual glitches? (Yes/No, description)

**Expected Behavior:**
Previously (before Option D), UI would freeze for 8-15 seconds during connection.
